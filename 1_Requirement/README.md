## Requirements
 The prime objective of the calculator is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. The possible number of calculations is pre-defined. The results of the calculations may be presented in summary or detailed format.

 ## Introduction
    An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
    The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).
    In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space.


## Research
This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.
### Impact of Calculator Technology
The calculator has had a profound impact on the world, making computations quicker and more exact. In the classroom, calculators have given many students the ability to learn about and put complex formulas and concepts into practice more easily.
The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.

## Cost and Features and Timeline
 As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.
 According to the Vintage Calculators Web Museum, the calculator featured a 12-digit display in red LED and cost $395 when it first went on sale in January 1971.
 Texas Instruments introduced its first calculator, the Datamath (or TI-2500), later that year. The device carried out basic arithmetic and sold for $149.95.
 By the 1980's four-function calculator prices broke through the $10 barrier. This would have seemed impossible a decade earlier. A few days ago I saw a brand new four-function calculator on sale for $1 at a discount store.
 In the mid 1960s a state-of-the-art, battery-powered, transistorized portable calculating machine might weigh more than 50 pounds (23 kg) and cost in excess of $2,000.The most expensive product is HP 50g Graphing Calculator priced at Rs. 85,859. Contrary to this, the lowest priced product is Oreva 1210 Basic Calculator(10 Digit) available at Rs. 94.

## Defining Our System
    -- This system helps solving mathematical problems in a easy way. It scans the keypad waiting to pick up an electrical signal when a key is pressed. Converts the numbers and functions into binary code. They are number stores where numbers are stored temporarily while doing calculations.
  A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:
  To perform the calculation 25 + 9, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: 25+9=34
    
    
## SWOT ANALYSIS :
### STRENGTH'S
 The ultimate strength of  Calculators is its innovative and user-friendly products. Calculators are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial, etc. Their technological expertise is one of the greatest. Workforce with more than 10000 people and powerful marketing has made it a market giant among tech-based businesses. Calculator has the trust of people, which is valuable than any other strength. Also, they have a huge loyal customer base all over the world.
 This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
 
### WEAKNESS'S
-- Dependency
Even though calculators can do the basic operations instantly, students should not use it all the time. When a student is always dependent on a calculator for solving problems of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it may make them incapable of solving these basic operations manually. 

-- Cheating
The availability of graphic calculators has made it easier for students to cheat during their tests. Besides letting you perform basic mathematical operations, these calculators allow you to store information like notes, formulas etc. This gives students an opportunity to store unauthorized information to cheat on the test. This is one of the major disadvantages of a calculator.

-- High cost
While the cost of a simple calculator is not that high, calculators like the graphing calculator is of high cost. In addition to that, these calculators need batteries to operate which is again a recurring cost.

 
  ### OPPORTUNITE'S
 The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And Calculator is comparatively already one step ahead than other's. Because since the beginning of childhood, we got introduced to Calculator as a helping partner in mathematics. We accepted it as a companion, and an emotional attachment grew. So if Calculator launches any innovative products for the youth generation, they won’t think much before give it a try. Also, sponsoring different events and working towards the educational improvement campaigns can add more segments to their customer base.
 
 ### THREAT'S
 


## 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

### Who:
1.Use in education
2.Calculate basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3.Medical and engineering made easier


### What:
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. 
 A calculator is a person who performs arithmetic or other mathematical calculations.

 ### When:
 BLAISE PASCAL, the French Mathematician, invented the first adding device in the year 1642. It was a clever device driven by gears and capable of performing mechanical addition and subtraction. It was called the Pascaline.
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available later around 1970s.
The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.

# Detail requirements
This Calculator specifies the functional requirements for a multi-function calculator program.
The program is designed to act like a “handheld calculator” with the usual standard functions
(add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation, and memory). Additionally, the calculator
will have the additional capability of performing functions in binary (base 2), octal (base 8)
and hexadecimal (base 16), in addition to the usual decimal (base 10). The program is designed
to be as easy to use as a regular calculator.
