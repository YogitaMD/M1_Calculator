## Requirements
 The prime objective of the calculator is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. The possible number of calculations is pre-defined. The results of the calculations may be presented in summary or detailed format. 


 

 ## Introduction
    An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
    The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).
    In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space.


## Research
This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.


## Cost and Features and Timeline
 As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

## SWOT ANALYSIS :
 --- STRENGTH'S
 The ultimate strength of  Calculators is its innovative and user-friendly products. Calculators are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial, etc. Their technological expertise is one of the greatest. Workforce with more than 10000 people and powerful marketing has made it a market giant among tech-based businesses. Calculator has the trust of people, which is valuable than any other strength. Also, they have a huge loyal customer base all over the world.
 This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
 
--- WEAKNESS'S
-- Dependency
Even though calculators can do the basic operations instantly, students should not use it all the time. When a student is always dependent on a calculator for solving problems of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it may make them incapable of solving these basic operations manually. 

-- Cheating
The availability of graphic calculators has made it easier for students to cheat during their tests. Besides letting you perform basic mathematical operations, these calculators allow you to store information like notes, formulas etc. This gives students an opportunity to store unauthorized information to cheat on the test. This is one of the major disadvantages of a calculator.

-- High cost
While the cost of a simple calculator is not that high, calculators like the graphing calculator is of high cost. In addition to that, these calculators need batteries to operate which is again a recurring cost.

 
 
 
 
 --- OPPORTUNITE'S
 The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And Calculator is comparatively already one step ahead than other's. Because since the beginning of childhood, we got introduced to Calculator as a helping partner in mathematics. We accepted it as a companion, and an emotional attachment grew. So if Calculator launches any innovative products for the youth generation, they wonâ€™t think much before give it a try. Also, sponsoring different events and working towards the educational improvement campaigns can add more segments to their customer base.
 
 --- THREAT'S
 


## 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

-- Who:
1.Use in education
2.Calculate basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3.Medical and engineering made easier


-- What:
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. 
 A calculator is a person who performs arithmetic or other mathematical calculations.

 -- When:
 BLAISE PASCAL, the French Mathematician, invented the first adding device in the year 1642. It was a clever device driven by gears and capable of performing mechanical addition and subtraction. It was called the Pascaline.
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available later around 1970s.
